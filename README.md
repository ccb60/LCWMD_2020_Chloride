Analysis of the 2020 Conductivity - Chloride regression for Long Creek.

#  LCWMD
The Long Creek Watershed Management District (LCWMD) is a Maine quasi-municipal
non-profit corporation that manages water quality in the Long Creek watershed on
behalf of about 130 land owners.

The Long Creek Watershed, a bit over two square miles in area, is dominated by
commercial land use. The Maine Mall is one of the largest land owners in the
watershed, and it is surrounded by a range of commercial businesses, from
medical offices, to car washes.  About a third of the watershed in impervious
surfaces like roads, parking lots, and rooftops.  Landowners with an acre or
more of impervious area are required to get a Clean Water Act permit for
stormwater discharges from their property.  The LCWMD provides an alternative
for landowners to working to receive an individual permit.  Landowners who elect
to participate in the The Long Creek Watershed Management District receive a
General Permit, in return for providing funding to the District, and
facilitating the work of the district by permitting access to their property for
certain activities.

The District has been in operation for more than ten years.  During that period, 
it has monitored conditions at multiple locations on Long Creek, making Long 
Creek among the best-studied urban streams in the Northeast.

# Purpose
This repository contains two analyses related to understanding the impact of
winter salt use on the health of Long Creek. 

These were both "side analysis" undertaken to address data quality issues, as 
part of annual reviews by LCWMD and our GZA, the long-term monitoring
contractor for LCWMD.

I serve on the Board of the LCWMD, and provide statistical support from time
to time in response to requests from LCWMD or GZA staff.

##  Conductivity-Chloride Regression
Each year, the LCWMD monitoring contractor conducts an analysis of accumulated 
chloride and conductivity data, and updates the "official"" prediction equation 
that LCWMD uses to estimate chloride levels (for which there are appropriate 
regulatory thresholds) to conductivity measurements (for which there are not).

During review of the 2020 data, GZA staff identified several outliers.  LCWMD
sought my opinion regarding how to handle the outliers. While the primary 
goal of that analysis was to evaluate how best to handle those two outliers, I
took the opportunity to examine the chloride-conductivity relationship more
generally, which shed some light on LCWMD's long-term approach to estimating 
chlorides from conductivity.

## Questionable Data from September of 2020
The repository also contains graphical review of questionable conductivity data
collected by sonde in September of 2020.  While this analysis is not directly
related to the chloride-conductivity regression, the connection to observed
conductivity (which is used, via the conductivity-chloride relationship to
estimate chlorides) makes it relevant for understanding the LCWMD chloride data.

# Data Sources
Both data files in this repository (in excel format) were shared with me via 
e-mail.  They came in e-mail exchanges with Peter Carney, the Director of
the Long Creek Watershed Management District and staff from GZA.

All data were collected according to the LCWMD Monitoring Plan and a Quality 
an approved Assurance Project Plan (QAPP).  The analyses included here are 
effectively part of LCWMD and GZA's ongoing data quality assurance efforts.
